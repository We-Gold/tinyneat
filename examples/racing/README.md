# Racing Example

A NEAT example adapted from an [old project](https://github.com/We-Gold/AI-Racing/tree/master) that used Tensorflow.js.

The code has only been restructured for this purpose, so take the original code with a grain of salt (early high-school immature code).

### Local Testing

From inside this folder, run `npm i --no-save "../../"` to install the main package as a local dependency. Make sure that you have already run `npm run build` to populate the dist folder.
